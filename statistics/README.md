## Gaussian or Normal Distribution

In a continuous graph, data can be spread out in different ways. Either it can spread to left, or to left or jumbled up.

But there are many cases where data tends to be around a cental value with no bias left or right and the resulting distribution is called a normal distribution or a gaussian or a bell's curve.

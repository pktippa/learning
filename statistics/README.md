# Statistics

## Mean (mu)

Mean is "Average" value of the data. i.e add up all the values in the data set and then divide
by the number of values that we added.

## Median

Middle value of all the values, keeping the values in sorted order ascending. If the number of values are even number, then the median value is the average/ mean of two middle values.

## Midrange

The midrange value is the mean of highest and lowest values in the distribution.

## Mode

Mode is the most common value in the distribution. Ex: 75, 80, 100, 100, 100. Here 100 is the mode of the distribution.

## Range of distribution

Range is the difference between highest and lowest value in the distribution.

## Variance (sigma square)

How much the numbers are spread out and how far are they from mean.

## Standard Deviation (sigma)

Square root of `Variance`

Watch below Youtube video for explanation

## Gaussian or Normal Distribution

In a continuous graph, data can be spread out in different ways. Either it can spread to left, or to left or jumbled up.

But there are many cases where data tends to be around a cental value with no bias left or right and the resulting distribution is called a normal distribution or a gaussian or a bell's curve.

Normal distribution is helpful for [Kalman Filters](https://github.com/pktippa/ai-training/blob/master/machine-learning/kalman_filters.md)

In Normal distribution we need to define a range, Ex: what is the probability of getting rain between 4.5 to 5.5 cms.

We mark the points and we calculate the area under these points which gives us the probability.

The `mean`, `median` and `mode` for this distribution all are equal.

# English Spoken Language

Parts of Speech(POS) - it referes to types of words.

## Noun

A `noun` is a part of speech(POS), `Nouns` identify people, places, things and ideas.
Nouns can be categorized as either **common** or **proper**.

`Common Nouns` name general people, places, things, and ideas, while `Proper Nouns` name specific people, places, things, and ideas.

Examples:

| Common Noun | Proper Noun |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| maid | Mrs. Sanders |
| president | Barack Obama |
| sister | Alan |

Typically, the first letter in a `common noun` isn't capitalized unless that common noun is the first word in a sentence.

## Verb

The `verb` signals an action, an occurrence, or a state of being. Whether mental, physical, or mechanical, verbs always express activity.

Examples: Go, run, make, do, strike, travel, exist

## Subject

`Subject` is one of the two main parts of a sentence. (The other main part is the **predicate**.)
The subject is sometimes called the `naming part` of a sentence or clause. The subject usually appears `before` the predicate to show (a) what the sentence is about, or (b) who or what performs the action.

The subject is commonly a noun, pronoun, or noun phrase.

Types of Subjects

-----------------

A subject may be one word or several words.

The subject may be just a single word: a `noun` or a `pronoun`. In this first example, the proper noun `Felix` is the subject of the sentence:

> `Felix` laughed.

In the next example, the personal pronoun `he` is the subject:

> `He` laughed.

The subject may be a noun phrase--that is, a word group made up of a head noun and any modifiers, determiners (such as `the`, `a`, `her`), and/or complements. In this example, the subject is `The first person in line`:

> `The first person in line` spoke to the television reporter.

Two (or more) nouns, pronouns, or noun phrases may be linked by `and` to make a compound subject. In this example, the compound subject is `Winnie and her sister`:

> `Winnie and her sister` will sing at the recital this evening.

A Note About Subjects in Questions and Commands


In a `declarative sentence`, as we've seen, the subject usually appears `before` the predicate:

> `Bobo` will return soon.

In an `interrogative sentence`, however, the subject usually appears `after` a helping verb (such as `will`) and before the main verb (such as `return`):

> Will `Bobo` return soon?

Finally, in an `imperative sentence`, the implied subject `you` is said to be "understood":

> `[You]` Come back here.

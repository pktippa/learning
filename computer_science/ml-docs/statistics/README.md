1. Karl Pearson's coefficient.

Correlation coefficients are used in statistics to measure how strong a relationship is between two variables. There are several types of correlation coefficient: Pearsonâ€™s correlation or Pearson correlation is a correlation coefficient commonly used in linear regression.
* The value of r ranges between any real number from -1 to 1.
* Values of r close to 0 imply that there is little to no linear relationship between the data.
* Values of r close to 1 imply that there is a positive linear relationship between the data. This means that as x increases that y also increases.
* Values of r close to -1 imply that there is a negative linear relationship between the data. This means that as x increases that y decreases.


2. Slope of line of regression treating a dimension(for two dimensional) as the independent variable.

```
a = r*(Sy/Sx)
```
r =  Correlation coefficient, Sx = Standard deviation of x data, Sy = Standard deviation of y data.

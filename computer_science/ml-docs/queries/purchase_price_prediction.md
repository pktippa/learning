# Purchase Price Prediction

Need help on how to approach "Purchase Price Prediction" Machine learning problem.

I got a time series transactional data of purchase logs of different products

Ex: Product named "Y" purchased for "M" amount, on Date "D" at Location/Place "P" and 5-10 other features.

Now i need to predict, how much we need to pay for purchasing Product named "Y" on new Date "D1" at Location/Place "P1" and same 5-10 other features.

Need inputs on choosing

1. Machine library - I have TensorFlow 2.0 in my mind.
2. ML Model / Neural network arch need to choose - I have Linear Regression in my mind.
3. Training strategy - using TF 2.0
4. Inference/Prediction strategy - using TF 2.0
5. Model saving, loading, versioning. - Saving to / Loading from / versioning using AWS S3.
6. Machine Configuration - Dataset is small so i am Okay with Running on CPU.

# Vue.js

## Vue instance

When a Vue instance is created, it adds all the properties found in its data object to Vue’s reactivity system. When the values of those properties change, the view will “react”, updating to match the new values.

Properties in `data` are only `reactive` if they existed when the instance was created.

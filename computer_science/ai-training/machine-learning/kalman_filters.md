A `Kalman Filter` is a tool that helps to predict values. 

It is an iterative mathematical process that uses a set of equations and consecutive data inputs to estimate the values we are interested in associated with the object quickly. `Basically it is all quick mathematics`!

Kalman Filter work on [Gaussian or Normal Distribution](https://github.com/pktippa/learning/blob/master/statistics/README.md).

It is a two step iterative process
1. Predict
2. Update

TODO - need to complete the full understanding.

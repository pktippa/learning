# Introduction

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the study of the computational treatment of natural (human) language.

In other words, teaching computers how to understand (and generate) human language.

NLP draws on research in Linguistics, Theoretical Computer Science, Mathematics, Statistics, Artificial Intelligence, Psycology, Databases, etc.

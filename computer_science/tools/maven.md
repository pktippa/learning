Maven is a build tool that was developed and designed for Java and other languages,

and it automates the most common build tasks that need to be done.

One of those tasks is dependency management, which is a major component of Maven.

Out of that, we get a robust artifact repository system

And it has plugin system.

A Maven build for a project is defined and controlled by the Project Object Model,
POM

It uses cordinates group name, Artifact name a version number.
